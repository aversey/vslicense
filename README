-= Very Simple License

License text itself is in LICENSE file.
Don't forget to replace <year> and <author> in it with specific values.

-= Motivation

I love permissive licenses: they are simple and actually readable.
Probably the shortest and the simplest permissive license is ISC license,
yet, it containts quite agressive DISCLAIMER (in caps, yeap),
so I decided to take the best disclaimer I have met, disclaimer from zlib.
Also, ISC contains attributions requirement, I have removed it too.
As composition of disclaimer from zlib and terms from ISC vslicense was born.

Feel free to use it in your own projects.  ;)
